<h1>A GUI Shortcode Generator Help File</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for buying this plugin, I have put a great deal of work into it! I hope it exceeds your
    expectations.. All feature requests
    and bug reports can be left on the product page comments area for now, all bugs reported will be fixed promptly and
    feature requests will taken into consideration. Do know I have a lot more planned for this plugin. See the <a
            href="#intheworks">In the Works</a> section for more details.<br/>
    I also owe the folks over at <a href="http://tinymce.com" target="_blank">TinyMCE</a> or <a
            href="http://www.moxiecode.com/" target="_blank">moxiecode</a> a big thanks for the great product they
    provide. It really adds some more awesomeness to the plugin. Without it there would
    be but a simple text area requiring the need for HTML knowledge to use the plugin.
    I will be donating a portion of each purchase to them. I also want to give a shoutout to
    <a href="http://www.hughlashbrooke.com/2014/02/complete-versatile-options-page-class-wordpress-plugin/">Hughlashbrooke</a>
    for providing a
    good settings class base.
</p>

<p>Please do note, this file is
    provided but you can find all the help information found here in the "Help" tab in the upper right hand corner on
    the generator
    page within WordPress.</p>

<h2 id="enclosing">Create a shortcode that surrounds content with an HTML element. (Enclosing)</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Fill in the Shortcode Tag Name field. This should be as short as possible, unique, but as descriptive as
        possible. ( No need to have the "[]" as they will be stripped out and do not worry about the underscores, when
        you click out of the field it will put them in for you. ).
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the HTML TAG Name field. ( Read notes under fields as this can be overridden )</li>
    <li>Give your HTML element an 'id' if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as this can be
        overridden ).
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some base classes if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as
        you can add to this set later using shortcode attribute "class" )
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some inline styles if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as
        you can add to this set later using shortcode attribute "style")
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some additional attributes that you may need or require. ( Remember you do not need to
        create the HTML attributes "class", "style", or "id" but any other attribute you wish your element to have
        should be noted here. )
    </li>
    <li>Describe your shortcode, this description is inserted in the code in a comment block before the function begins,
        it may be handy when looking to change the specifications of a previously generated shortcode as you have chance
        to compare the code before actually committing to the code regeneration rewrite of the php file. ( I would not
        recommend those without coding experience to tamper with previously created shortcodes if they have used them
        already, unless the new one only adds NEW attributes or conditions while leaving everything else exactly the
        same. )
    </li>
    <li>Add any external JS references you need.</li>
    <li>Add any external CSS references you need.</li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some attributes, if you need them, to map to your HTML attributes, display some conditional
        content below what is wrapped, or reference their values inside conditional content using the attribute
        reference syntax..
    </li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some conditions, if you need them, to check values of attributes and display additonal
        content below the wrapped element.
    </li>
    <li>Press "Generate Shortcode".</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="selfclosing">Create a shortcode that is replaced with content. (Self-Closing)</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Fill in the Shortcode Tag Name field. This should be as short as possible, unique, but as descriptive as
        possible. ( No need to have the "[]" as they will be stripped out and do not worry about the underscores, when
        you click out of the field it will put them in for you. ).
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the HTML TAG Name field. ( Read notes under fields as this can be overridden )</li>
    <li>Skip down to the describe your shortcode area.</li>
    <li>Describe your shortcode, this description is inserted in the code in a comment block before the function, it may
        be handy when looking to change the specifications of a previously generated shortcode as you have chance to

<h2 id="attibutesyntax">Shortcode attribute syntax explained</h2>

<p>The shortcode attribute syntax is based off of the same idea as the shortcodes themselves but instead of activating
    what is called a callback function, it just lets you embed variables within the generated shortcode functions. What
    that means is when anywhere inside a TinyMCE that an attribute name is encountered in between dual less than and
    dual greater than signs, it replaces it with the value fed from the shortcode when used.</p>

<p>Here is an example assuming you have a shortcode attribute named "link_text":
    <code>I just love all the cool design features of the &lt;&lt;link_text&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here is an example assuming you have a shortcode attribute named "image":
    <code>This is the best picture I've ever seen of the mountains &lt;&lt;image&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>In both of these examples the attribute names and the "<" ">" signs will be replaced with what ever value the
    attributes are equal to when using the shortcode they were created with.</p>

<h2 id="regenerate">Regenerate an existing shortcode</h2>

<p>Simply ensure the "Regenerate Code" option is set to "Yes". I only advise those who are comfortable looking at PHP
    code to perform regenerations as if a shortcode has already been used and you regenerate it, then you change the way
    it works, your site might break. The only way to prevent that is to make sure you ONLY extend the functionality of
    the shortcode and everything else remains the same. Please be cautious using this.</p>

<h2>Preview generated code before writing to file</h2>

<p>Simply ensure the "Preview Generated Code" option is set to "Yes"</p>

<h2 id="compare">Compare already existing shortcode function before writing regenerated code to file</h2>

<p>To compare an already existing shortcodes function to one you might want to replace it with is as simple as trying to
    generate a shortcode with the same tag without having "Regenerate Code" or "Preview Generated Code" options set to
    "Yes". When these options are set to "No" the generator first trys to find a shortcode with that tag. If it does
    then it will display the tag, old code, and proposed code so you can compare. As long as you do not leave the page,
    you can do this as many times as needed so you can tweak your shortcode many times to get them working how you
    like.</p>

<h2 id="styles">Adding CSS to Shortcodes</h2>

<p>There are two ways you can load CSS into the page where your shortcode is being used.</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can use embedded or internal &lt;style&gt; body { background: #FFF; } ;&lt;/style&gt; tags.</li>
    <li>You can use inline styling.</li>
    <li>You can use external styles by adding them in the area provided in the form. ( Recommened )</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="scripts">Adding JS to Shortcodes</h2>

<p>There are two ways you can load JS into the page where your shortcode is being used.</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can use embedded or internal &lt;script&gt;alert("I'm some JS");&lt;/script&gt; tags as long as you use ONLY
        double quotations ("). Single quotes (') will not work.
    </li>
    <li>You can use inline functions like onclick() and the like.</li>
    <li>You can use external scripts by adding them in the area provided in the form. ( Recommened )</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="intheworks">In The Works for coming releases...</h2>
<strong>Looking to get all these in by 1.4.0. I plan on having monthly releases. Until then, it shouldn't be hard for
    you or someone else to customize the
    output to your needs. You can find code samples that are copy and past solutions at the <a
            href="http://moezaick.com/agsg-demo/">demo site</a> for this plugin.</strong>
