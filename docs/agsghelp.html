<h1>A GUI Shortcode Generator Help File</h1>

<p>Thank you very much for buying this plugin, I have put a great deal of work into it! I hope it lives up to your
    expectations and more. All feature requests
    and bug reports can be left on the product page comments area for now, all bugs reported will be fixed promptly and
    feature requests will taken into consideration. Do know I have a lot more planned for this plugin. See the <a
            href="#intheworks">In the Works</a> section for more details.<br/>
    I also owe the folks over at <a href="http://tinymce.com" target="_blank">TinyMCE</a> or <a
            href="http://www.moxiecode.com/" target="_blank">moxiecode</a> a big thanks for the great product they
    provide. It really makes adds some more awesomeness to the plugin. Without it there would
    be but a simple text area requiring the need for HTML knowledge to use the plugin. Please due note this file is
    provided but you can find all this information in the "Help" tab in the upper right hand corner on the generator
    page within WordPress.</p>

<h2>Create a shortcode that surrounds content with an HTML element. (Enclosing)</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Fill in the Shortcode Tag Name field. This should be as short as possible, unique, but as descriptive as
        possible. ( No need to have the "[]" as they will be stirpped out and do not worry about the underscores, when
        you click out of the field it will put them in for you. ).
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the HTML TAG Name field. ( Read notes under fields as this can be overriden )</li>
    <li>Give your HTML element an id if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as this can be
        overriden ).
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some base classes if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as
        you can add to this set later using shortcode attribute "class" )
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some inline styles if you are making an enclosed shortcode. ( Read notes under fields as
        you can add to this set later using shortcode attribute "style")
    </li>
    <li>Give your HTML element some additional attributes that you may need or require. ( Remember you do not need to
        create the HTML attributes "class", "style", or "id" but any other attribute you wish your element to have
        should be noted here. )
    </li>
    <li>Describe your shortcode, this description is inserted in the code in a comment block before the function begins,
        it may be handy when looking to change the specifications of a previously generated shortcode as you have chance
        to compare the code before actually committing to the code regeneration rewrite of the php file. ( I would not
        recommend those without coding experience to tamper with previously created shortcodes if they have used them
        already, unless the new one only adds NEW attributes or conditions while leaving everything else exactly the
        same. )
    </li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some attributes if you need them, to map to your HTML attributes, display some conditional
        content below what is wrapped, or reference their values inside conditional content using the attribute
        reference syntax..
    </li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some conditions if you need them, to check values of attributes and display additonal
        content above the wrapped element.
    </li>
    <li>Press "Generate Shortcode".</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create a shortcode that is replaced with content. (Self-Closing)</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Fill in the Shortcode Tag Name field. This should be as short as possible, unique, but as descriptive as
        possible. ( No need to have the "[]" as they will be stirpped out and do not worry about the underscores, when
        you click out of the field it will put them in for you. ).
    </li>
    <li>Fill in the HTML TAG Name field ( This is just required even if it is not going to be used - You can just put
        "blah" or better yet "self-closed", how about "ziptydoda" )
    </li>
    <li>Skip down to the describe your shortcode area.</li>
    <li>Describe your shortcode, this description is inserted in the code in a comment block before the function, it may
        be handy when looking to change the specifications of a previously generated shortcode as you have chance to
        compare the code before actually committing to the code rewrite of the php file. ( I would not recommend those
        without coding experience to tamper with previously created shortcodes if they have used them already, unless
        the new one only adds NEW attributes or conditions while leaving everything else exactly the same. )
    </li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some attributes if you need them, to map to your HTML attributes, display some conditional
        content below what is wrapped, or reference their values inside conditional content using the attribute
        reference syntax..
    </li>
    <li>Give your shortcode some conditions if you need them, to check values of attributes and display additonal
        content above the wrapped element.
    </li>
    <li>Press "Generate Shortcode".</li>
</ol>
<h2>Shortcode attribute syntax explained</h2>

<p>The shortcode attribute syntax is based off of the same idea as the shortcodes themselves but instead of activating
    what is called a callback function, it just lets you embed variables within the generated shortcode functions. What
    that means is when anywhere inside a TinyMCE that an attribute name is encountered in between dual less than and
    dual greater than signs, it replaces it with the value fed from the shortcode when used.</p>

<p>Here is an example assuming you have a shortcode attribute named "link_text":
    <code>I just love all the cool design features of the &lt;&lt;link_text&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>Here is an example assuming you have a shortcode attribute named "image":
    <code>This is the best picture I've seen of the mountains &lt;&lt;image&gt;&gt;</code></p>

<p>In both of these examples the attribute names and the "<" ">" signs will be replaced with what ever value the
    attributes are equal to when using the shortcode they were created with.</p>

<h2>Regenerate an existing shortcode</h2>

<p>Simply ensure the "Regenerate Code" option is set to "Yes". I only advise those who are comfortable looking at PHP
    code to perform regenerations as if a shortcode has already been used and you regenerate it, then you change the way
    it works, your site might break. The only way to prevent that is to make sure you ONLY extend the functionality of
    the shortcode and everything else remains the same. Please be cautious using this.</p>

<h2>Preview generated code before writing to file</h2>

<p>Simply ensure the "Preview Generated Code" option is set to "Yes"</p>

<strong>Looking to get all these in by 1.4.0. Until then it shouldn't be hard for you or someone else to customize the
    output to your needs. I will try provide some code samples that are copy and past solution in the coming weeks to
